a. 
The first obstacle I struggled with was just determining how to test all the arrays. After 
the first couple of for loops, the format became much easier to organize, and coding the 
functions ultimately went very smoothly. Most obstacles were easily overcome by seeing 
what errors the compiler pointed out and regularly testing functions as I was completing 
them. I struggled a bit with figuring out how to code majorityElements, but after realizing 
that a majority element would be in both halves of an array, I realized that there were some 
easy ways to check through the array. Then, for rotateLeft, I struggled a bit with trying to 
figure out how to test if an array remained unchanged. It was figuring out that, for that to 
happen, amount%n would have to equal 0, that allowed me to properly code it.

locateMinimum(folks, 8); //properly locates minimum
locateMinimum(folks, -5); //returns -1 bc of negative n
countCommonElements( folks, 8, data, 5 ); //returns 1 bc arrays share 1 element
countCommonElements(folks, -1, data, 5); //returns -1 bc of negative n1
countVowels(folks, 8); //check that it counts the right number of vowels
countVowels(folks, 0); //returns -1 bc n = 0
hasThreeOfX(data, 5, "mama"); //check that it returns true
hasThreeOfX(data, -1, "mama"); //returns false bc n = -1
hasThreeOfX(data, 4, "mama"); //check that it returns false
majorityElement(data, 5); //check that it returns "mama"
majorityElement(folks, 5); //check that it returns ""
shiftRight(data, -1, 3, "rhee"); //returns false bc of negative n
shiftRight(data, 2, -5, "yeet"); //returns false bc of negative amount
shiftRight(folks, 5, 10, "oof"); //check that it changes array to 5 "oof"s and returns true
rotateLeft(folks, 5, 15); //check that it returns false (array unchanged)
rotateLeft(data, 5, 1); //check that it rotates all the elements left by 1
replaceAll(folks, 8, 'e', 'Z'); //check that it changes all e's to Z's and returns 5
replaceAll(folks, 8, 'O', 'a'); //check that it returns 0 and makes no changes
